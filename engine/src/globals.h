/*
  A few words about the coordinate systems used by Shmup:

  Since the game must run on a lot of different hardwares with different screen size we have the concept of screen active surface and screen inactive surface.
  On an iPhone with 320/480 screen , the entire screen is considered active surface.
  On an iPad with 780/1024 screen , the active surface is actually 682x1024. We have two black bands 784-682 = 102: 51 pixels wide each (and or course 1024 high).
  The two black bandes are inactive surface.

  The openGL viewPort is set to draw the active surface centered on the screen. 
       - In the case of the iPad the viewport is rendering at an offset (51,0) and dimension w=682 h-1024.
	   - In the case of the iPhone the viewport is set to render at 0,0 with w=320 and h=1024.











  Menus and buttons are placed in a coordinate system where 0,0 is at the center and the width is 320 and height 480 (so coordinate limits are [-160,160] and [-240,240])
    
  In order to make inputs interaction easier to interprect a button also features an "iphone_coo_SysPos" where coordinate system is centered at the upper left and is [0,320] [0,480].
  This is the SHMUP virtual screen (it actually matches the original iphone screen coordinate system).
